## Watch the Road Signs
The main goal was to classify road signs images. Convolutional Neural Network was used as target model to achieve this goal. Road signs dataset source is [Chinese Traffic Signs](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dmitryyemelyanov/chinese-traffic-signs) dataset from Kaggle platform.
